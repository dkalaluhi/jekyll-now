I am completly, unashamingly stealing that title from [@rebeccafitzhugh](https://twitter.com/RebeccaFitzhugh)'s general session, at the [@WPAVMUG](https://twitter.com/WPVMUG) User Con that was held Feburary 28th.


I often feel stuck in not only my career and career progression, but in my current role as well. This doesn't really have anything to do with title advancement, or switching companies, but how I measure myself and beter myself. My yard stick is long: I've been lucky enough to surround myself with  really, REALLY smart people. People that know way more than me, are better at just about everything I do than me, but who are none-the-less, willing to put up with me.


While listening to Rebecca's talk a few weeks ago, something about how she ended up where she is now, struck me as brilliant. She asked a simple question; "what am I looking for?" and then hit the google machine to find companies that matched her criteria. Well, that was easy! So I started asking questions today, three of them actually, and I think these will really help me not get stale in my skills and knowledge.


## The Questions

__1) What don't I know?__

That is a loaded question right? First of all, how do I know what I don't know? I know it's a lot, but what don't I know. This question isn't as hard as you think. If you are like me, look at your bookshelf, see all of those books you want to read but haven't? Yup, that's probably a good place to start. If you don't have a bookshelf, go to your local Barnes and Nobels, find your topic of interest, and start looking at the books on the shelf. Write all of those things down, ( I use a 5x8 note card, or 50...hey, there's a lot I don't know), and put that card aside.


__2) Where do I want to be?__


This may or may not be a physical location/company. For me, it is not. "Where do I want to be, with my skills?" or "Where do I want to be, with my knowledge?" are more applicable for me.  Mileage may vary. For me, it is a list of certifications, responsiblities and peronal achievements, I would like to achieve, __IN MY CAREER__! Not my personal life; my goals [there] are completely different! There are seven things on that list. Keep this list small, because each one of those things, may be a super big task. Having a list that seemingly goes on month after month can be discouraging. But keep this list small.


Now that I have that list on where I want to be, I've rated the items from one(1) to three(3): one(1) being the most important to me and three(3) being the, not unimportant, but the things that can wait a little bit longer, or in the case of being a [fix me]Red Hat Accelerator, will come, most likely, with the other efforts ranked higher on my list.


__3) Pick a number one item...__


...and make a card for it. I personally title the card, "Name of Item - How to do I get there?" This works for me. On this card, I write the steps to getting to the title, duh! If this item happens to be, POTUS, then you're doing it wrong. Ultimately, this item should be roughly 3-5 steps. If it's a higher level certification, step 1, would probably be getting the prerequisite cert. My workflow for my RHCA is, as follows:

Now that all of that is done, repeat step 3 for all of your number one's. And you're done...at least with the self analysis part. This whole process shouldn't really take you longer than an hour or so to complete. If you spend too much time on this, you're doing what you need to be doing:

So, you don't like this method? you've got something better? I'd love to hear about it in the comments! And, like always, you can email me [here](mailto:dave.kalaluhi@gmail.com), or leave a comment below.
