Or, don't talk to me; I'm an introvert!

Or, all conferences need a quiet space, with someone to talk to.


DISCLAIMER: I am not a psychologist! I do not hold a degree as a doctor, nor have I ever worked in the mental health field. Hell, I don't even hold a degree!


Several years ago, in another life, we had to take the [Myers-Briggs](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/our-theory) personality test. The course, and subsequent test, was to help people to identify and be able to work with, one of the 16 different personality types. I, am an [ISTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality). Whether or not these classes worked for "working with a team" or not, is a different topic. I'm going to assume that we learned: "Sharing is Caring", back in our kindergarten days, or even before.


What I did learn from those classes and that test, was more about me. How I worked, and why I felt like I did when certain things happened. What I would like to focus on, for the remainder of this post, is the I, in my ISTJ personality type. The I, means Introvert, or Introversion, depending on where you get your information. When I got my results back, I thought to myself: "Introvert? How can that be?? I love to go out and meet people!" Well, that's because we introverts can be social, in the [Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung) sense of the word.


I do like going out, and I do like meeting new people. Ask any of my friends! Before I got on the plane to leave for a technical conference in Vegas last year, I ran into 2 people I knew. When I deplaned, I ran into someone that was heading out, who I hadn't seen for years. I'll buy you a drink at the bar, I'll talk to everyone at the Craps table. Hell, I'll talk to anybody I meet along the way during the long walk from the Luxor to the convention center. I enjoy it! But, as I [re]found out during [#VMWorld](https://twitter.com/hashtag/VMworld?src=hash) 2017, I have a limit.


This hard limit is mostly ethereal. I don't know when I'll be done, but mark my words, at some point, I WILL be done. My limit at [#VMWorld](https://twitter.com/hashtag/VMworld?src=hash) was right about the end of Day 2 (Monday), right at the beginning of the [#VMWorldHackathon](https://twitter.com/hashtag/VMworldHackathon?src=hash). I couldn't do any more. I was angry. I was irritable. I was exhausted! Not really physically exhausted, but mentally. I could have stayed awake all week, physically, but mentally, I was just Done. With a capital D!


We got into Vegas Sunday, for TAM day. Our TAM is awesome! He took us around, introduced us to a TON of new people. Smart people! Good people! It was a whirlwind of new faces. Monday, between sessions and introductions, it was another whirlwind, more people, more stories. Here's my twitter, here's my blog, let's collaborate on this idea, here's my card. Stop by the solution exchange, vendor meetings, introductions, technical talks. It was nonstop.


By 8PM Monday night, I was done. I couldn't do it anymore. I asked the captain of my hackathon team what he needed, he was engrossed in a discussion and answered "nothing". F-U, nothing? I'm out. I grabbed a couple beers off the table, and headed back to my room. My breaking point was HOURS before that. I fired up social media and completely disconnected. I unfollowed, I removed myself from groups and chats, I blocked, I muted, I did everything I could to mentally checkout. If I couldn't leave Vegas, this was the next best thing.


At home, after a night of socializing, I go home. I sleep in my own bed, I recharge with family. I ask my wife how her day was, if the kids are still awake, we talk about school. No pressure at home. Just a husband and father, doing the things we do. I could go out and meet people every night, at home. That's how I recharge. What I failed to realize was, I didn't have that support system, that stability, that recharge point. I am an I. An introvert. I also failed to realize or better yet, recognize what impact all of this would have as my tank reach empty.


The next day, I was still a little grumpy. It wasn't until about halfway through the day, that I had realized what had happened. Not really what, but, why. After the flight home, and talking with some really awesome people from the community, I realized, I wasn't alone. There are others that felt the same, probably worse: Frustrated, Loneliness, Tired. Are they all introverts? That doesn't really matter. [#VMWorld](https://twitter.com/hashtag/VMworld?src=hash) needs a mental health space. A therapist or counselor on-site, someone people can talk to, and a place to disconnect, even if it's only an hour. A quiet place, with those groovy [Google sleep pods](https://www.geek.com/gadgets/google-uses-high-tech-nap-pods-to-keep-employees-energized-1264430/). Hell, I'll even volunteer to man space next year, but don't worry, I won't talk to you while you're there!
