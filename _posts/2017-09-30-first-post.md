...and also my first learning experience.

Ok, this may not actually be my **first** learning experience. I have made it through 37 years, so somewhere along the way, I did learn something. But this is first one I'm blogging about: Jekyll.

While my friends over at [#PGHLittleHacks](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PGHlittlehack?src=hash target="_blank") decided to check out [HUGO](https://gohugo.io) at the first Little Hack. I wanted to a go a more, traditional route and start with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.org).

After some trial and error, going through [get started](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/), I ended up with a local reposity for Jekyll: ie `jekyll serve` and my github pages repository: [dkalaluhi.github.io](https://dkalaluhi.github.io), or what you are reading now. I'm sure there is probably a better do this, but for now, this works for me. The trick for this setup, is in order to run view your changes locally, prior to uploading to your github repository, you have source your local github.io repository. Once I figured out how to do that, it was easy peasy. `jekyll serve --source /path/to/repository` Now you can view your changes locally, before uploading them to you blog.

My goal for this initial step, was just to get it up and running. Goal achieved. Next is turning the basic [theme forJ ekyll, minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) into an actual functional blog. With at least, the bare functionality. I will be working on doing this over the course of the next week. I've decided to track these things with [issues](https://github.com/dkalaluhi/dkalaluhi.github.io/issues) in github, for two reasons; 
1. Keep track of things I'm working on, so I don't forget.
2. Keep myself accountable for this project.

That about sums up my work so far with Jeykll.

Keep Learning,

Dave
