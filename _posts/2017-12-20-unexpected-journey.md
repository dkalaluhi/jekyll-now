I begin today, which is fitting being a Wednesday, a most unexpected Journey. I realize that Gandalf first came to our beloved Mr. Baggins on Tuesday, but the adventure really begins the the throng at supper on Wednesday. So too, does my journey begin; not with thirteen dwarfs showing up at my door, singing songs about chipping my glasses, but with 26 books to read and digest.

Most of my endeavors are technical books, books to help me with my job. But a few of these are for enjoyment, like the one that I have alluded to about, and a few, I can only hope, will be for wisdom, knowledge and leadership.

I recently read an article from the [ThoughtCatalog](https://www.thoughtcatalog.com) about reading to lead, which can be found [here](http://tcat.tc/11IMfX8). One of the insights I gleaned, was to "read above your level". Of those twenty-six books, which I will be adding onto that number in near future, I fear I have no business reading; [Atheist Delusions: The Christian Revolution and Its Fashionable Enemies](https://goo.gl/8yo76s) and [Beauty of the Infinite: The Aesthetics of Christian Truth](https://goo.gl/rjKLtW). Both of these books are by the same author, [Dr. David Bentley Hart](https://goo.gl/TjNgSc) and came recommended by an equally, if not smarter man. I will get back to those two behemoth undertakings once I (re)start them. I had started Atheist Delusions, once, but put it down due to work constraints and the fact that I haven't had the time to read since starting my family; and more recently, I've been far too busy making excuses, as to why I have no time to read, to read.

So I set out on my journey. I gathered every book in my home that I either need to read (work), want to read again (for purpose), or want to read to lead (wisdom) and stacked them on my desk in my office. I quickly realized that reading to lead was going to be extremely hard. Not because I'm too stupid to understand what I'm reading, but because I'm out of reading practice. Luckily, in that stack on my desk, was a few books that I had already read, that I love, and that I knew I could get through, because I enjoy them so much. So I started with The Hobbit. Not only do I get enjoyment from reading Tolkien and his ilk, but I feel there is wisdom to be had, even in their fiction. What wisdom there is, is what I hope to find out. But the journey and (re)discovery will be amazing.

This post is the basis for so many things to come. It's about seeking wisdom, it's about being a leader and learning to read, it's about my commonplace book. This blog is about learning, teaching, and public speaking. It's about my current life in tech, and my future life in tech. Recently, I was selected to be a 2018 [Red Hat Accelerator](https://access.redhat.com/accelerators), so in full disclosure, it'll contain Red Hat specific tech stuff. I'll toss some religion, theology and philosophy just for good measure, as well as some updates on what I'm reading. As I get older, I realize how much stuff I just don't know: for instance, I never heard of a locus communis until earlier this year. As I work to set one up for myself, I'll be posting a lot on that, why I made the decisions I did, and how you can set one up as well. I feel that the commonplace book, is essential to reading, to learning, and to acquiring wisdom. As Saint Jerome said, "To read without writing is to sleep."

So, as I set out on this Journey, it is my hope that I will be able to increase my learning, my capacity to remember, and a breadth of wisdom that I can pass on. I also hope, that as I take this journey, I can inspire someone to follow along and to embark on their own journey of discovery. And if I can help you along the way, I would be glad to do so. Like Albert Einstein said, "Wisdom is not the product of schooling, but the life long attempt to acquire it."
